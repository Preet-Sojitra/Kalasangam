# Kalasangam

> Initial project was made during the SSIP 2023 Hackathon. This project was developed within 24 hours. Initial code is present in the branch [v1.0](https://github.com/Preet-Sojitra/Kalasangam/tree/v1.0). Then I worked alone on this project and added new features and improved the existing ones. The final code is present in the [main](https://github.com/Preet-Sojitra/Kalasangam) branch.

## Description:

Kalasangam is an e-commerce platform for buying and selling handmade products. It is a platform where artisans can sell their products and customers can buy them. Kalasangam offers a comprehensive solution by providing a user-friendly ecommerce platform that integrates mixed reality technology. Through our platform, customers can experience the products virtually, enhancing their shopping experience and increasing engagement. Meanwhile, local artisans benefit from a feature-rich dashboard and analytics tools, allowing them to manage their listings efficiently and gain insights into their sales performance.

## Usage:

To use Kalasangam, you need to run it on your local machine only as of now. To do so, follow these steps:

> You need to clone both the frontend and backend repositories to your local machine separately and start the servers for both of them separately.

1. Clone the repository using following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Preet-Sojitra/Kalasangam
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository and install the dependencies using the following command:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the server using the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

1. Now head over to the [backend repository](https://github.com/Preet-Sojitra/Kalasangam) and follow the instructions given there to install and start the backend server.
